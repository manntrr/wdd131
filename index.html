            <p class="info-me">My name is Tracy Mann and I go by Tracy.  I was born in Hornell, N.Y., USA.  I have moved around a lot in my youth, living in North Dakota, Minnesota and Western New York State.  I joined the Army out of high school and served in Fort Knox, Kentucky, West Texas, and Augsburg, Germany.  I returned to Western New York for school after leaving the Army, and got a job working in a Retail Grocery Store Help Desk in Retail support.  I have worked my way through the company into an Engineering role, now supporting Advertising Technology and Marketing Technology.  The company I work for is called Ahold/Delhaize.  My company had moved me to Greenville, South Carolina in 2001.  A few years later I moved to Simpsonville, South Carolina, a close suburb of Greenville and I have been here since.  I am sealed to my wife Haydee, and we have no children at this time.  We love to visit her family in Peru when we can and see other sites as well.</p>
